\section{Interests}
My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning, robotics, and computer vision. Broadly, I build machine learning systems \& algorithms for agents -- such as robots, cars etc. -- to learn from informative human signals at a large-scale. Most of my work has been in multi-modal sensor-rich robotic settings, for which I have developed sensory fusion deep learning architectures. I have developed and deployed algorithms on multiple robotic platforms (PR2, Baxter etc.), on cars, and crowd-sourcing systems.

 
\iffalse

for humans to help machines -- such as robots, cars etc. -- become smart by implicitly providing
learning signals. I am particularly interested in learning from signals that are easy to
elicit at large-scale but are inherently weak and noisy. I am recently
exploiting the potential of crowd-sourcing feedback to teach robots good trajectories in
context-rich environments and using vision based human feedback for
assistive cars.
