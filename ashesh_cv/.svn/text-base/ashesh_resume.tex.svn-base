\section{Interests}
My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning, vision and
robotics.
I build machine learning systems \& algorithms
for agents -- such as robots, cars etc. -- to learn from informative human signals;
particularly learning from signals that are easy to
elicit at a large-scale but are inherently weak and noisy. Recently, I have been
%am recently
exploring the potential of crowd-sourcing feedback to teach robots in
context-rich environments and using vision based human feedback for
assistive cars.

for humans to help machines -- such as robots, cars etc. -- become smart by implicitly providing
learning signals. I am particularly interested in learning from signals that are easy to
elicit at large-scale but are inherently weak and noisy. I am recently
exploiting the potential of crowd-sourcing feedback to teach robots good trajectories in
context-rich environments and using vision based human feedback for
assistive cars.
